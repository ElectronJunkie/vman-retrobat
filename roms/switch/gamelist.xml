		<desc>Virtua Racing or V.R. for short, is a Formula One racing arcade game, developed by Sega AM2 and released in 1992. Virtua Racing was initially a proof-of-concept application for exercising a new 3D-graphics platform under development, the "Model 1". The results were so encouraging, that Virtua Racing was fully developed into a standalone arcade title. Though its use of 3D polygonal graphics was predated by arcade rivals Namco (Winning Run in 1988) and Atari (Hard Drivin' in 1989), Virtua Racing had vastly improved visuals in terms of polygon count, frame rate, and overall scene complexity, and displayed multiple camera angles and 3D human non-player characters, which all contributed to a greater sense of immersion. Virtua Racing is regarded as one of the most influential video games of all time, for laying the foundations for subsequent 3D racing games and for popularizing 3D polygonal graphics among a wider audience</desc>

		<name>Super Mario 3D World + Bowser's Fury</name>
		<desc>Enjoy two Mario adventures solo or with friends!

Pounce and climb through dozens of colorful courses! Mario (and his friends) can use a variety of power-ups like the Super Bell, which grants catlike abilities like climbing and scratching. Team up with up to three other players locally or online to reach the goal and see who can get a high score.

Explore a seamless feline world in the new Bowser’s Fury adventure

Free-roaming Super Mario gameplay makes a return in this brand-new adventure. Bowser has become gargantuan and lost all control! Explore Lake Lapcat and its islands, complete objectives to collect Cat Shines, and team up with Bowser Jr. to bring his big, bad dad back to normal. Just watch out for Bowser’s island-wide attacks.

The Super Mario 3D World + Bowser’s Fury game features the same great co-op gameplay, creative levels and power-ups as the original game, but with added improvements. In the Super Mario 3D World part of the game, characters move faster and the dash powers up more quickly. Both adventures support the newly added Snapshot Mode—pause the action to get the perfect shot, apply filters, and decorate with stamps!

In Super Mario 3D World, choose from Mario, Luigi, Peach, and Toad and set off to save the Sprixie Kingdom. Each character has a distinct playstyle—Luigi can jump extra high and Peach can float for a short time. Rosalina is also available as a playable character later in the game! Jump, dash, and pounce to reach the goal while collecting Green Stars, coins and power-ups.

Collect stamps throughout your adventure in Super Mario 3D World and use them in Snapshot Mode (in both Super Mario 3D World and the Bowser’s Fury adventure) to create masterpieces to share with friends and family.

In Bowser’s Fury, Mario arrives on Lake Lapcat and is confronted with a rampaging Bowser! Join forces with Bowser Jr. and venture through an interconnected world made of cat-themed…well, everything. Enemies, flowers, and even birds take on a feline form.

Need some extra assistance bringing Bowser out of his frenzied, furious state? Another player can take control of Bowser Jr. and help out by attacking enemies and storing power-ups. Two sets of claws are better than one!</desc>

		<desc>Help Ruggnar explore gloomy places with his bag and a few candles as his sole equipment. It's a dwarf's story! As the veins of his city are depleted and the valley is deserted of its inhabitants, rumors of taverns come to Ruggnar's ears. Abandoned places contain incredible treasures that are just waiting to be picked up. Equipped with his bag and a few candles, he goes on an adventure to make his fortune! Ruggnar has a limited amount of candles to help him in these dark places. Help him manage his supply. Seeing the path ahead of you, activating certain mechanisms, or simply lighting up: it's up to you to find the perfect use for each candle! And if you throw one, remember to pick it up. It might come in useful soon! There are no enemies to kill here, but many traps are in your way. Hidden by the darkness, you may find yourself face to face with an axe, a fireball, or other nasty things. Don't worry, move carefully, use your candles, and everything will be fine. After all, Ruggnar is very agile for a dwarf and he gets up quite easily after an accident. Observe your surroundings, listen to the noises around you, throw your candles. The traps are there. It's up to you to avoid them! Throughout your journey, unlock new abilities. Visit the merchant to learn the secrets contained in ancient grimoires to improve your candles and equipment or to buy the latest items in stock. Need a change? Many beard dyes, armors, and helmets are hidden. Find them and create your own style! But that's not all! Explore every corner with smooth controls, experience the hand-forged story mode, and enjoy the procedural generation that extends the gameplay. Discover the story behind this humorous adventure and listen to the voice talents of Pierre-Alain de Garrigues (PADG, French voice-over) and Jordan Harrelson (English voice-over) as they lend their talents to Ruggnar so he can swear louder and louder!</desc>

		<desc>Rumble Sus is a fast-paced social deduction party game that pits Innocents against Traitors. Up to eight local players can join in the chaotic fun, but Nintendo Switch Lite users will require extra vibrating-supporting controllers for local multiplayer mode. At the beginning of the game, players learn their identity by whether or not their controller is rumbling, all without the others knowing. Once the game starts, Traitors need to find teammates and try to defeat all the Innocents without being exposed. Meanwhile, Innocents need to utilize items on the map and their wit to find dubious players and defeat all the Traitors. Use a radar and feel the rumble to detect Traitors. There's no need to vote, punch, or bomb your enemy directly. Teamwork can be the key to winning, but it can also destroy friendships. Pick up your controller and have a chaotic game full of laughter and suspicion with your friends!</desc>

		<desc>Papertris is a fast-paced, excitingly designed arcade puzzle game that combines classic gameplay with fresh new features. Papertris is an interesting and fun arcade puzzle game in which colored cubes can be combined in all 6 possible directions and you decide where to place them. It offers not only the classic puzzle variant, but also different depths. There are also power dice and numerous possible combinations in a carefully hand-painted classic but modern game of skill. The Challenge mode is complicated with different challenges in which the player has to solve the corresponding tasks to pass to the next level, which becomes more difficult with each new level. You can earn points whenever you can in the endless mode, which gets faster and harder from level to level. The 2-player VS mode requires tactical skill in which players can use numerous combos to send Blocking Dice to block the opponent's options. Dice combinations in all 6 directions, atmospheric music, color-blind icon option, dark mode, and full controller compatibility. The game itself was co-designed with a lot of fun and ingenuity by my kids (4 and 2 years old) and most of the game was hand-drawn by them, which gives it a lovely charm. We really had a lot of fun creating and generating ideas for the game and hope to inspire you as much as we did.</desc>

		<desc>One-of-a-kind, unique action! The protagonist, Kuuta, attacks the enemy using his club. Kazemaru sucks the enemy's spirit out of its body, and by destroying that spirit, Kuuta can then claim victory. Enjoy an all-new, unique co-op experience by playing both Kuuta and Kazemaru at the same time! A different way to level up! Kisejima, where the game takes place, is divided into three areas with a variety of challenges ranging from fighting enemies to escort missions. The player can also level up by running away from pursuing monsters, like a game of tag, and collecting mushrooms that grow in clusters to purchase upgraded clubs. Setting: Kisejima Island The story takes place on Kisejima, a small island in the middle of the ocean. Here, it is said that the power that lies dormant within the local demon spirits can be drawn out by challenging them to trials, where ancient demons who were once defeated by Momotaro are summoned to battle. However, few have ever returned from Kisejima alive. Characters: Kuuta, a demon warrior, and his spirit partner, Kazemaru Kuuta, the protagonist, is the only survivor of the Demon King's army that faced Momotaro in battle. He and Kazemaru, a mysterious spirit that lives on Kisejima, team up to take on challenges of all shapes and sizes! Artwork by KENEI DESIGN Kisejima may not be large, but the colorful artwork by KENEI DESIGN, with its dazzling green meadows, looming forests, and plains of floating megaliths, offers a unique emotional impact unlike any other action game. Its solo creator has invented a mini-world in which each and every location is marked by its own memorable appeal. ONI is an invitation for players to enjoy a small-world experience, for a change!</desc>

Luckily, it just so happens that you're trained in the art of mortal combat! Learn how to fight, upgrade your abilities, venture through increasingly hostile worlds, and restore the Eternal Flame. FIGHT, ADAPT, AND PERSEVERE Adapt and take on enemies using a multitude of moves and attacks including punch combos, fiery dashes, wide area-of-effect stomps, and powerful finishers that deal decisive damage. But don't get too reckless - smart stamina usage is essential. Each biome in Flame Keeper is inhabited by unique foes and obstacles of increasing difficulty. Consult the trusty Bestiary as you unlock insight into the strengths and weaknesses of your enemies.YOUR BUILDS, YOUR PLAY STYLE It's not enough to let your fists do the talking. Sometimes... you need a little pick-me-up. Upgrade Ignis to your heart's desire via skills and passive abilities. Collect seeds from defeated enemies to learn new skills and complete specific tasks to receive runes and unlock helpful passive abilities. Mix and match to create tons of different builds! HERE'S TO YOUR HEALTH To restore the Eternal Flame, you must scour each environment for what remains of its energy and transfer it back into each stage's Fire Camp. Here's the twist: the energy you collect also acts as your health. You need to deplete it to charge up each Fire Camp, but you also have to stay healthy to explore ever deeper. Find the right balance and discover your best way to play.RECHARGE IN VULPIS VILLAGE At the start of each level lies Vulpis Village. The Vulpis are friends to a brave charcoal like yourself, so they're happy to provide a service.

Out of battle, Mario can use the arm-extending 1,000-Fold Arms ability in specific spots to interact with the landscape to pull, peel, hit, and more! Join Mario, Olivia, and their companions on a journey of laughter and emotion, thrills, and a whole lot of folding.</desc>
