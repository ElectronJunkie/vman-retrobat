		<desc>Become an emergency medical technician in Emergency Call Ambulance. Day or night, you're on the call! Race to the scene of a serious traffic accident, spectacular fire or senseless act of big city violence. You're mission: get the injured to the hospital emergency room as quickly and safely as possible! Players are kept aware of their patient's condition by monitoring their 'health point' indicator. Reckless driving or hitting other vehicles will dramatically reduce your patient's 'health point' indicator. Follow the on-screen directions or choose your own route. The game ends if the 'health point' indicator reaches zero before you deliver the patient to the hospital. Make it in time, and you're off to the next emergency call!</desc>
