		<name>Final Orbit &amp; Bumper Bash</name>
		<desc>*** 2 GAMES (Final Orbit + Bumper Bash Pinball : to switch between games use the left CTRL. ***	You are a space destroyer defending Earth against the Trillians. The Trillians are using attack bases to launch Kamikaze satellites and Trillian fighters at Earth.

When a satellite or a fighter gets close, your weapon will automatically track their vertical motion. You must track them horizontally and fire at the right time. You lose energy when a fighter shoots you or when a fighter or satellite explodes on Earth. If you see a fighter with a white stripe (the back of the fighter), keep it on the screen for five seconds and you will come to an attack base. Destroy the attack base to regain energy.

If you lose all your energy, you will explode.</desc>

		<name>Spider City</name>
		<desc>You are Flash Gordon. Many spacemen have entered Spider City but never returned. Your job, Flash, is two fold. Rescue any spacemen you find in the tunnels of Spider City and destroy all the hatching pods. The lower part of the screen is a map. You are the horizontal line, the hatching pods are the vertical lines and the Disrupters are the crosses. The upper part of the screen is the close-up of the action. You rescue spacemen by touching them with your ship. You destroy hatching pods, and the spider warriors that hatch, by flying to the pods then shooting the warriors. You can also shoot generators, patrol ships and debris. Shooting the generator will keep the Disrupter from moving about the city for a little bit but the debris never stops while you are within, so don't hang out in the Disrupter. If you destroy five warriors at one hatching pod or your ship is destroyed when it returns, you will have a shield for a short time. There will be two beeps to warn you of the shield leaving. The scoring is as follows: 10 points = Debris 25 points = Patrol Ship 70 points = Rescued Spaceman 100 points = Disrupter Generator You get 100 points for killing the first warrior at a pod, 200 for the second, 300 for the third and so on. You lose 1,000 points if you shoot a spaceman, but Flash Gordon would never do that, right? Every time you conquer a city, you get an extra man.</desc>

		<name>Star Trek - S.O.S</name>
		<desc>Star Trek: Strategic Operations Simulator is an arcade action game where you take control of the Starship Enterprise. Your mission is to save the Federation from NOMAD! Before you get a chance at destroying NOMAD, you'll have to battle your way through ten levels (each consisting of multiple rounds). In each round you may encounter Klingon fighters, deadly anti-matter saucers, asteroid fields, and deadly meteors, all of which are capable of depleting the Enterprises energy. The game ends when your energy supply has completely run out. To fight these dangers, the Enterprise is equipped with an unlimited supply of phasers and a limited supply of photon torpedoes. Each round also contains one or more starbases; if you dock at a starbase, some of your supplies (such as energy and torpedoes) will be replenished. The game is played from two points of view; the top of the screen contains a third person view of the Enterprise (along with the ships gauges), and on the bottom of the screen is a first person point of view</desc>

Each surviving Llama gives you a bonus at the end of each stage. You have three lives in your quest, and the aliens shoot back. Each time you get hit by an alien, an alien shot or a rampaging llama you lose a life. Once all lives are spent, the game is over.</desc>

In addition to the robots the player also has to avoiding running into walls that will kill him upon contact.

		<desc>In Catcha Snatch, the player takes the role of the store detective Barney Bootlace. He walks around the store, which is represented with one top-down screen, to do his job: guiding lost children back to their mom, bringing lost items to the lost property office, busting shoplifters and rushing bombs out of the door. Practically this boils down to touching the item/person in question and walking to the destination. Barney's success is measured by his manager's approval from 0 to 99% The approval rises when Barney manages to handle an issue correctly and decreases when he misses something. If 99% are reached, Barney is promoted to the next level (and a higher difficulty) - however, a demotion and a written warning follows directly after falling to 0%. After three warnings the game is over, but one warning is removed for advancing two levels.</desc>

You can "cave in", which means deleting your path which the enemies usually follow. While this game does borrow some aspects from games like Pac-Man and Snake, the game has no levels and, like in Berzerk, you can move freely around the screens.</desc>

		<name>Chuck Norris Superkicks</name>
		<desc>In this action game you play the part of Chuck Norris on a quest to reach a monastery where an important leader is kept hostage. The game consists of several different screens: when beginning and between fights you will see a view of the path that leads to the monastery. Walking along the path, you will encounter numerous enemies. When fighting, the view switches to a close up of your current location. By pressing the joystick button and moving the joystick in one of four directions you can perform various kicks, punches, and blocks. The enemies you encounter are varied, and some can only be defeated by certain moves. The path you walk along will occasionally split up into two or more choices; when this happens, only one choice is correct and the others are dead ends. If you choose incorrectly, you'll have to back track a bit and try again. Beginning as a white belt, you will slowly increase in rank as you win fights. By the time you reach the monastery you need to earn black belt status in order to defeat the deadly ninjas inside! Your quest must be completed within a time limit, or the game is over. Walking off of the path or losing fights will also cause you to lose even more time. Was also sold as part of a double pack along with Artillery Duel.</desc>

		<desc>Gameplay in Clowns shares some similarities with Breakout, but this time the bricks has been replaced with balloons that you get points for popping. To reach the balloons at the top of the screen you have to move a seesaw under a jumping clown. This will launch away the clown already standing on the seesaw, hopefully towards the balloons. Balloons comes in three different: yellow, green and blue. Yellow balloons are the easiest to reach, while the blue are the hardest. Therefore you also get more points for the harder to reach balloons. If you manage to clear all balloons of a color, you'll get bonus points. Balloons of that color will then be replenished. You have five jumpers to your disposal, and you will lose one every time you miss to catch the landing clown. Clearing all blue balloons will give you an extra jumper. Clowns can be played by one or two players using paddles, although the C64 does have two versions, one which is paddle only, and another that is joystick controlled.</desc>

		<desc>Crater Raider is a multi-screen action game. The object of the game is to destroy a giant asteroid that is on a collision course with the planet Earth. The player must guide Raider Rick over the surface of the asteroid, jumping over craters and avoiding flying meteorites (and aliens, in the later stages). The player starts with three lives and will lose one if Rick falls into a crater or is hit by a flying object. Rick's supply of oxygen is limited, but more oxygen can be obtained by picking up canisters that are strewn about the asteroid's surface. If Rick runs out of oxygen, the game will end. When the 20th screen is reached, a bomb must be dropped in the large crater. Once the bomb is dropped, the player has only three minutes to guide Rick back to his ship before the bomb explodes. If Rick's mission is successful, the player will earn an extra life and proceed to a more difficult asteroid. The game has nine levels of difficulty.</desc>

		<name>Crossfire</name>
		<desc>In this adaptation of the arcade game Targ your job is to defend your city from marauding alien beasts. You can simultaneously maneuver your craft and shoot in four directions while patrolling the regular grid of streets - the enemy has surrounded your city block, and attacks are coming in from all sides as the aliens swarm in with all guns blazing. To survive, you'll have to blast your way out by darting in and out of the line of fire and taking down the assailants with your own volleys: once they're all eliminated, you go forth to the next level, to face yet another wave. Ammunition is limited, and from time to time you'll have to restock by picking up a fresh supply. Every level contains four bonus crystals: as time goes by, they emerge one-by-one to be picked up, and each is worth twice as much as the last. The game starts you off with three ships, though you get a fresh one for every 5000 points you score.</desc>

		<name>Cyclon</name>
		<desc>Cyclon is a space-themed reflex game that is similar to Midway's Space Zap. The object of the game is to survive as long as possible by defending your star base from enemy star cruisers and deadly satellites. The game has 99 levels of difficulty, and the player may begin at any level from 0-10. The player's star base is located at the center of the screen and enemies firing light missiles will approach from all sides. The star base is armed with lasers that can be fired in all four directions, as well as a limited amount of anti-matter bombs which destroy all on-screen enemies. Shields can also be activated to intercept enemy shots. Firing lasers and using shields will use up energy, and if the player's energy runs out, their star base will explode. If the player does not destroy enemies or intercept their shots, their missiles will inflict damage to the player's star base. Shields will be rendered unusable on any part of the base that is hit by an enemy. The star base will be vaporized if the enemy shots penetrate the reactor at the base's core. The player starts the game with three bases and will earn an additional one each time a level is completed. Additionally, any extra energy remaining at the end of each round will be converted to extra points. When all of the player's star bases have been lost, the game is over.</desc>

		<name>Deadly Duck</name>
		<desc>In Deadly Duck the player controls the titular character who must shoot his bill bullets at crabs, the bricks they drop, and dragonflies. Each level starts with eight crabs. The crabs grab bricks from the sides and try to drop them on the player-controlled duck. It is possible to shoot the crabs and the bricks as they fall, but if a brick lands on the duck, he dies. When a brick lands on an empty spot, it will stay on the pond for a moment, preventing the duck from moving horizontally. On levels two to four there are two, four and six dragonflies, respectively, moving together just under the crabs. The player receives ten points for shooting the dragonflies, but this makes them angry. When angry, they drop one, two or three bombs (depending on the level). If the duck is next to a bomb when it explodes, he is killed. The game continues until the player runs out of ducks, which are equivalent to lives in other games.</desc>

They can be played through in one go, or the player can pick any of them without completing the previous ones. The enemies in each stage has their own tactics in taking out the player. In the first wave the enemies try to crash into the player, while the aliens of the second and third stage fires at the player. The player ship can only move along the bottom and shot up against the enemies. The fourth stage is the one that differs the most from the other stages. Here the enemies follow the edges of the screen and shoot in towards the player who now can move around the screen freely. What's more, it's also possible to shoot in two directions, both up and down. The player has five lives and it's game over when they are all lost. Three different skill levels can be chosen from.</desc>

		<name>Key Quest</name>
		<desc>Released in 1983 by Microware for the VIC-20 and written and programmed by Randy Ubillos and David Dixon. A two page review of the game was written up in the December 1983 edition of Compute!’s Gazette. However, nothing in the review discusses its development. It does however provide a detailed look at gameplay. The premise of the game is simple. A wizard stored up treasures in the dungeon beneath his fortress. He also created creatures called Gorbs to defend his treasure. You control a character running through the dungeon to collect treasures. The Gorbs chase you through the maze-like dungeon. It actually has a bit of a PacMan feel to it. You have to collect treasures spread throughout the dungeon rooms, and once you collect 12 a key will appear. You pick up the key and then have to make it to the door, which leads you to the next portion of the dungeon. You are able to defend yourself against the Gorbs, but in a limited way. You can fire either to the right or to the left. The Gorbs also will not go near the treasures, so you are in a safe space when you get to them. You gain points for collecting treasure, shooting Gorbs, and by how quickly you complete each stage. There were four unique screens to work through and when you finished them, they repeated, only with more Gorbs moving at a higher rate of speed.</desc>

Using laser beams, you need to prevent the mutant herds from destroying your powerhouse. The game was even more complicated than this, however, as it was possible to enter the burrows and to shut them down. Once a burrow was entered, you started another phase of the game. A queen mutant and her eggs are hiding in each burrow. You must get to the eggs and plant an explosive charge, while avoiding the queen mutant, who can kill you or move your charge away from her eggs. Once you have succeeded in blowing up the eggs, the burrow is sealed. When you return to the powerhouse screen, you will have one less burrow spewing mutants at you. The game was even more complicated yet, in that, after each burrow is sealed, your lasers get weaker and the next burrow will have more eggs and be more challenging. You will have won the game when you have sealed all the burrows and successfully protected your powerhouse</desc>

Once you reach a barrier in the maze, you are automatically rotated, but you can always manually change direction. There are red ones who chase after you, and black ones who are activated when you get close to them - both types kill you on contact. When they are close, you can activate a Star Screen to block them off. The Radar of the title is on the right of the screen, and shows you where each piece of cheese is, although the actual maze is not illuminated, so your next snack might be further away than you think.</desc>

Since the VIC never sold well in Japan, only a small number of these were released. But since it was a really good game, and not wanting to be limited by their license agreement with Namco, Commodore changed the car graphics to be a cat and mouse and released the game worldwide as VIC-1910 Radar Rat Race. Use your radar to hit the course checkpoints and shoot for a high score! Players control a car and dodge pursuing red cars while collecting flags.

		<name>Rat Hotel</name>
		<desc>In Rat Hotel the player takes control of a rat and has to eat cheese while not being caught by Waldo, a rat hating maintenance man. It takes place at Hotel Paradisio and on each of the hotel's floors the rat has to eat all pieces of cheese to be able to take the elevator to the next floor. At the same time it has to watch out for Waldo and the traps that he has placed all over the hotel. Any contact with Waldo or a trap will lead to one of three lives being lost but an extra one is granted after 10,000 points. There is a time limit too as the rat only has three minutes to move from the top to the bottom floor. The colour of the cheese changes over time and it's important to not eat it when it's black as this will paralyse the rat. However when it turns to blue it's worth double points compared to the orange one. Once the rat has eaten the big cheese in the basement the level has been completed and it will move on to a harder one. The difficulty level can also be chosen before starting the game. Coded by a female game developer, Joanne Lee also known as Jolee.</desc>

		<path>./Serpentine.NTSC.prg</path>
		<name>Serpentine</name>
		<desc>In Serpentine you control a multi-segmented snake in a maze; your goal is to survive and earn as many points as possible. At the beginning of each level, three enemy snakes will also enter the maze. To complete the level, you need to eat all of the enemy snakes. If an enemy snake has more segments than your snake, you can only eat segments that form the tail of the snake; a collision with the head is lethal! Each time you eat a segment, the enemy snake will become smaller until eventually you can devour it completely. For enemy snakes that have fewer segments than you, you can eat the tail segments or the head segment. From time to time, a frog will appear in the maze; eating this will cause your snake to grow. Both your snake and enemy snakes will leave eggs behind occasionally; left alone, these will hatch (your eggs earn you an extra life, enemy eggs will hatch another snake). Eggs can also be eaten to remove them from the playfield, so it's usually a good idea to eat enemy eggs before a new snake hatches! The maze changes for each level, and the enemy snakes progressively become larger and tougher to catch. Unlike the other releases of this game, which were developed by Broderbund (who were also the publisher of the other versions), the VIC-20 version was ported by Antirom Software and published by Creative Software). The VIC version was also the second to be released, just after the original Apple II version. The rest of the conversions were released in 1983.</desc>

		<desc>*** Paddle only ***	Skibbereen is a Breakout game for two players (Pong with bricks is another way to describe it) based on Irish folklore. Each player uses a paddle to move a bat up and down and uses it to hit a ball. They both have a set of bricks to protect and behind them there is also a pot of gold that is worth extra much when hit. The player that first destroys the opponent's bricks as well as pot of gold will win the game. But to complicate things there are also snakes that at times enter the screen. These have to be avoided since hitting them three times will lead to a game over for both players. The game has nine difficulty levels which differ in the speed of the ball as well as the snakes. The game does not have any AI opponents so it can not be played in single player (unless the player wants to control both paddles).</desc>

		<desc>Spills &amp; Fills is an educational game whose aim is to develop the skills of proportion, coordination and perception in children ages 6 to 12. The player's task is to fill beakers with water using the least amount of fill ups and spilling as little water as possible. There are two kinds of beakers, the object beakers that have to be filled and the master beakers that are used to do it. To do so the player controls a crane that allows him to pick up master beakers and fill them with water from a faucet which then can be emptied into the object beakers. The game is completed when all of the object beakers are full. There are two kinds of scores for the player to keep track of, number of fills and the amount of water spilled. There are two different levels of difficulty. On level 1 all object beakers are the same shape but different in size, while on level 2 they differ in both shape and size.</desc>

Amok is also the name of a space station located far out in space that the player has to make his way through. Like in Berzerk, the player controls his character from a top down perspective and can move and shoot in multiple directions. Each room is inhabited by a number of robots that have run amok and are trying to kill the player. In addition to the robots the player also has to avoiding running into walls that will kill him upon contact. The robots have different colours (green, blue, red, black) that indicate how many points they are worth. Green are worth only five points while the black ones are worth 35. After scoring 1500 points the player earns an extra life. The game consists of nine skill levels. Unlike the original Amok, Super Amok only came on cartridge.</desc>

Topper is strongly influenced by, and a variation of, Q*bert. You control Topper by moving the joystick in diagonal directions to jump from tile to tile. You must land on each tile to change its color. But the tiles do not want to be painted so some will blink out, causing you to fall and lose a life if you are standing on them or were jumping to them. Every four levels, the difficulty increases. You will later encounter dynamite that will pop from tile to tile. If you land on a tile with dynamite, it will explode and you lose a life. Further along, you will also have one or more rabbits that, if they are on the same tile with you, will cause you to lose a life. After all lives are lost, the game is over. In a two player game, play alternates.</desc>

		<desc>Video Mania is an arcade-action game similar to Robotron. 
The game is played on a single screen and the player can move and shoot in any direction. Around alien creatures roam and the player has to shoot them down before they collide with him. The only defence available is a football shaped electronic alien zapper that is thrown at the aliens. Unlike Robotron it's played with only one joystick and therefore the player can only shoot in the direction that he is moving.

There are three different enemies. The evil eye which bounces off when hitting a wall, the walwoker which climbs walls when they hit and otherwise move in unpredictable ways and the killerbox which always follows the player. Each killed alien is worth 50 points and once all have been killed a new level is started with a larger amount of enemies. The player starts with three lives and after every 10th level the player gets a bonus life.</desc>

		<desc>Apple Panic is a platform game based on the arcade game Space Panic (1980, Universal) and ported to the Apple II by Ben Serki. You control a digger, armed with his shovel, and you must kill your opponents - the evil legged apples. Your character can only walk left/right and climb up/down the ladders - no jumping - and if the apples touch you, you'll lose. To kill an apple you must dig a hole on the ground and wait for one of them to get stuck on it. Then you must hit it with your shovel to make it fall to the level below. The apples die if they fall deep enough. Depending on their color, they may require from 1 to 3-level falls, so you may have to dig several aligned holes. Besides, the deeper the fall, the higher you score. Each level is timed so you must take out all the apples quickly, or you'll lose. If you're successful, the next levels will feature more and more enemies than the previous one.</desc>

Once all camels on a level had been killed, the player had to survive a "hyperspace" sequence which required avoiding high-speed missiles.

		<desc>In the sequel to The Way of the Tiger, Yaemon the Grand Master of Flame is the villain of the piece. He has killed your foster-father Naijish and stolen the Scrolls of Kettsuin.

Your quest to recover the scroll and avenge your father's death is viewed from above and superficially resembles Gauntlet. You start outside the  Quench Heart Keep, and must initially find enough keys in the grounds and connected buildings to penetrate it, and then kill each of the 3 guards.

There are other prey including spiders to fend off - these know how to home in on you. You are armed with a limited number of Shuikch to shoot from distance; after these are gone you are reliant on your bare hand, although more can be collected. Pressing the 1 key summons an energy recharge from the God Kwon, but only a limited number of times.</desc>

		<desc>Bandits is a similar game to the classic Space Invaders. However, in this game not only spaceships are attacked, but the invaders also try to grab fruits. The game is over when either all the player's spaceships are destroyed or all fruits were stolen. There are several types of invaders, that also attack together in the higher levels. To stand your ground against the rising number of enemies, a protective shield can be switched on.</desc>

		<path>./Capture the Flag.prg</path>
		<name>Capture the Flag</name>
		<desc>Capture the Flag is a 3D maze game where one player has to capture the flag, while the other tries to stop him. It is one of the earliest games that allow the player 360 degrees freedom of movement, and it is a sequel of sorts to Wayout. The player can choose to be an invader or a defender. The invader must find a way to exit the labyrinth through one of two doors, beyond which lies the flag. Each successful flag capture scores 1 point and resets the maze for another round. The defender can score points by capturing the invader, which is simply done by running into him, thus preventing the invader from reaching the flag. The two flags (or "doors" as the game calls them) are represented by flashing walls, and when the players see each other they are represented as blue or green moving walls. The music changes dynamically and becomes more intense when the invader and defender are close to each other. After a successful capture of either the flag or the invader, a new labyrinth is randomly generated.</desc>

		<desc>Your friend is trapped inside Ghost Manor! There are five different screens you need to get past before you can rescue your friend from the top floor of the manor. The game begins in the graveyard outside the manor; here you play tag with a friendly rainbow ghost or skeleton which will supply you with spears you can fire at enemies. In the second screen, you approach the guarded entrance of the manor. Using the spears you collected, you need to shoot all of the enemies blocking the entrance. The third and fourth screens take place inside the manor; each floor has a set of stairs as well as several treasures and crosses which can be collected. There is a moving wall on each of these floors which is deadly to the touch, so be careful! The final screen is the top floor of the manor where your friend is being held captive. Dracula guards this floor, and using the crosses you collected earlier you need to repel him into a prison and free your friend. To make the game more challenging, there is a time limit; you must complete all of this in four minutes or less! You can play the game as either a boy or a girl, and four different skill levels are available.</desc>

Throughout the corridors of the maze the player will find gold bars lying around that he can collect. He can also find vitamins which allows him to kill the monsters. When charged by the vitamin the monsters will automatically be killed when the player moves into the same square as them. If the player would not be charged he would instead lose one of his nine lives. The maze consists of multiple levels. When the player is done with one he can move to the next by jumping into a hole which will take him deeper into the maze. As the player progresses the difficulty will increase with him.</desc>

Rocks, cacti, scorpions, and other obstacles should be avoided or you'll crash and lose valuable time. Next you'll race a winding path uphill through the woods. This section has a top down view, and you'll lose time if you wander off the track or crash into obstacles. The final segment of the race takes place on the beach with a side scrolling point of view. Various obstacles and other racers will all get in your way here! If you crash too many times, or take too long the game will be over.</desc>

The game is not a faithfully conversion of the movie however - your unit has already been killed off when the game starts and you will battle scorpions, enemy soldiers and dodge obstacles etc, before facing the Predator itself a number of times.

The game is a fairly standard run-jump-shoot platformer, except that you start with no weapons at all and must collect them as the game goes on.</desc>

		<name>Scorpion</name>
		<desc>The Scorpion battle machine is a new anti-terrorist device. Scorpion is being tested in a simulated refinery sabotage scenario. You move Scorpion along a network of pipelines, collecting bombs as you move along. Avoid the moving obstacles and shoot all bomb layers to clear the current level and move on to the next one.

Since Scorpion can only move along the pipelines, you have to plan your way through each level carefully in order to avoid all those moving enemies. Fortunately, they move along in repetitive patterns and don't chase you. Gameplay is not easy because you have to very precisely take turns at the junctions. The game features Parallax scrolling.</desc>

Similar to Defender it is possible to move both left and right but here the objective is simply to destroy a number of creatures in each level. There are four different creatures with different behaviour but all lead to death upon contact: bats, dragonflies, wasps and spiders of Mars. Bats flutter about without shooting while dragonflies leave trails of deadly dust bombs which home in on the player. The wasps appear from the right and fire stings swiftly at the player. The spiders descend from the top and spin webs that prevent the player from moving. If they reach the ground they will start firing new webs upwards. The player has three lives and gets an extra one upon reaching 10,000 points.</desc>

The first screen shows you approaching the mountain; you begin here each time you start a game or lose a life. All you need to do is walk up the path to begin the stage you've reached so far. Flags by the path indicate how many lives you have left. The next screen is a zig zag path through meadows at the base of the mountain. Beware of the deadly bears and eagles here! Along the path are several caves which you can hide in when a bear or eagle appears (you can also jump over bears). The caves are cold, however, and you have a limited amount of time to hide before freezing to death. Make it to the top of the path, and you begin the next screen. Here you climb up a rocky ledge. Boulders and falling pieces of rock constantly appear and can knock you back down the screen. Next is the icy cap of the mountain. Climb up to the top without being knocked down by avalanches or getting caught by the abominable snowman. The last screen takes place at the mountain summit where you need to climb to the top and plant a flag before freezing! Complete all of these screens and you win the game. There are four different difficulty levels available.</desc>

Your mission is to defend the base against the invaders as they attack from 8 channels on both sides of the Star Post. You must also defend against a Superalien which disrupts your viewscreen as it spirals its way toward your Star Post.

There are 3 different game versions: Beginner, Advanced, and Hyper. You must maneuver your laser cannon in a circular or back-and-forth motion while firing on aliens. In addition, your outpost is equipped with a special SuperZap laser which eliminates all aliens currently on your viewscreen. SuperZap are added at the rate of 1 per level, and unused Zaps are stored for later use. Your Star Post can withstand only 7 alien hits per level of play. Each new level resets the number of hits to 0, but 8 hits in any one round destroys your Star Post.</desc>

		<path>./Sword of Fargoal (1982)(Epyx)[16k].prg</path>
		<name>Sword of Fargoal</name>
		<desc>In the game, the player controls a warrior who explores numerous dungeon levels in search of the legendary "Sword of Fargoal" artifact. The levels become progressively harder to survive as the player descends deeper and deeper into the dungeon. Each dungeon is covered in complete darkness that illuminates as the dungeon rooms and corridors are explored. When the Sword of Fargoal is successfully found, a clock countdown begins where the player must successfully escape the dungeon without it being stolen before the time expires, or the Sword is lost. The warrior gains character levels by gaining experience points, which increase the character's fighting ability and hit points, (called Hits), as they progress through the dungeon. There are several items in the dungeon that help the character, which can be found in treasure chests or on slain adversaries. Combat in the game is controlled by the computer, and the player has no control over how well or how bad their warrior fights. A warrior can flee an attack at any time, unless they fall victim to a sneak attack (which is when a monster engages in combat before the warrior has a chance to move). The warrior can move freely about the dungeon, whereas monsters take intermittently timed steps. Each dungeon has a number of staircases that go up or down. In the iPhone version of the game, there are even slippery staircases that will move a character down two levels. Because each map is randomly generated, a level the player returns to will not be the same as when they left it. Stairs also provide an entry for wandering monsters that, over time, replace slain ones on a level. In the iPhone version of the game, floors stay the same on a single game, but change when the player dies or starts a new game. Characters can find bags of gold scattered around the dungeon. The bags can be taken by enemies if they step over them. Gold can also be stolen from the character by humanoid enemies. If those thieves are killed, the gold is returned to the warrior. A warrior can only carry 100 pieces of gold, and Magic sacks must be located that allow the warrior to carry more. Each dungeon level contains a temple. Every time the warrior steps on a temple, their gold is sacrificed to their deity, which earns additional experience. In the iPhone version, shields the player is carrying will be renewed when they are blessed. If a warrior remains standing on a temple, it acts as a sanctuary where they become invisible to enemies around them. Chests in the game are both a bane and a boon to the player. Some contain something useful, or contain a deadly trap. Some chests explode, causing damage, and others release crumbling ceiling or pit traps. A player doesn't know, however, if a chest contains a trap or a useful item, and must take a chance of encountering either. Chests can be picked up by enemies if they step over them. There are six spells that can be found in the dungeon. There are several enemies in the dungeon. In general, "human" type enemies are more dangerous than creatures. Some new monsters appear in the iPhone version of the game, and "human" type enemies also carry (and use) treasure, such as potions. Often the game will describe whether the monster one encounters is strong or weak.</desc>

To make things more difficult you have limited time in form of a fuel tank which will get refilled after you cleared a number of waves. Besides that, your spacecraft is equipped with a laser that tends to overheat. Every shot makes the heat bar of the laser increase a bit. Once it reached its maximum you can't fire anymore and are forced to wait until it cools down while slowly running out of fuel.</desc>

Each section presents you with a road of houses, drawn from forced-perspective 3D, with flick-scrolling as you move up the road. Each house's dustbin must be collected, emptied and replaced within the time limit, which is indicated by the Bonus timer at the top of the screen. If this reaches zero, you receive the first of 3 warnings -  a third sees you out of a job.

Setting foot on the grass causes the onus to drop more quickly, and there are additional hazards to avoid, including the local cars, which appear to be driven by maniacs, and cyclists and barking dogs, which can both injure you and cause your movement to slow.</desc>

The flipper simulation is a mixture of pinball and breakout. The square-cut ball is rolled over the pinball table with the help of a double board similar to Breakout. As pinball elements, there are -next to walls- also two bumpers (upper right and left), the Commodore logo (in the middle of the screen), the light C O M M O D O R E with the corresponding targets, two spinners, four sideways ball traps (middle and bottom) and a point display. Furthermore, there is a time-sensitive ball barrier to avoid the ball going into out. The overview line with ball display, active player and points is in the first line of the screen. You have 3 balls per game.</desc>

The primary difference is that this time the aliens are not so much invading, as trying to rescue their criminal friends who are locked up in a prison at the center of the screen. The aliens will move from the side of the screen towards the prison. Each alien that reaches this prison will remove one brick. Once enough bricks are removed the prisoners will escape and it's game over. The game is pretty much a clone of the Universal arcade game Cosmic Guerrilla.</desc>

An ancient treaty between the United States and the Bungelings allows the U.S. to maintain a mail distribution center near where the hostages are being kept. You have smuggled an entire helicopter into the post office by disguising it as a mail sorting machine.

Suddenly you hear the sound of explosions. Looking out on the plain you see one of the Bungeling's barracks aflame. The hostages are running about frantically, desperate for a chance to escape. Bungeling planes and tanks are fast approaching lives may be lost. Your chopper is ready to go and fully armed - there is no time to waste.</desc>

		<name>Frogger</name>
		<desc>Your task in this arcade conversion is to guide a frog across a treacherous road and river, and to safety at the top of the screen. Both these sections are fraught with a variety of hazards, each of which will kill the frog and cost you a life if contact is made.

The road is full of cars and trucks, at variable speeds. The river water itself is fatal, as are the snakes which hover within on later levels. Frogger must use the arrangement of logs, turtles (which are only there for a short time) and alligators (but stay away form their faces), and then jump into one of the open home-cells, ideally one containing a fly for extra points. Once all holes have been filled, you move onto the next, harder, level.</desc>

		<desc>Galaxian is a shoot 'em up in which the player is at the bottom of the screen, with an arrangement of aliens at the top. The player moves left and right to aim at an alien, then shoots a bullet up the screen, and the alien it hits is killed. The aliens are classed as Drones, Emissaries, Hornets and Commanders, with those higher up the screen scoring more points when destroyed. At set intervals an enemy will move down the screen towards you, escorting a bomber, which is a moment of high danger. Clear a wave and another is generated.</desc>

		<path>./Gorf.prg</path>
		<name>Gorf</name>
		<desc>The player controls a spaceship that can move left, right, up and down around the lower third of the screen. The ship can fire a single shot (called a "quark laser" in this game), which travels vertically up the screen. Unlike similar games, where the player cannot fire again until the existing shot has disappeared, the player can choose to fire another shot at any time; if the previous shot is still on screen, it disappears. Gorf consists of five distinct "missions", each with its own patterns of enemies. The central goal of each mission is to destroy all enemies in that wave, which takes the player to the next mission. Successfully completing all five missions will increase the player's rank and loop back to the first mission, where play continues on a higher difficulty level. The game continues until the player loses all their lives. The player can advance through the ranks of Space Cadet, Space Captain, Space Colonel, Space General, Space Warrior, and Space Avenger, with a higher difficulty level at each rank. Along the way, a robotic voice heckles and threatens the player, often calling the player by their current rank (for example, "Some galactic defender you are, Space Cadet!"). Some versions also display the player's current rank via a series of lit panels in the cabinet. Note: None of the home ports have the Galaxians level due to legal issues with Namco, so all the official home ports only have four levels</desc>

		<path>./Omega Race.prg</path>
		<name>Omega Race</name>
		<desc>This is a remake of a Bally-Midway arcade game. You control a spaceship and shoot down the enemy "Droid" ships that attack you. Your ship must survive Droid-dropped mines too--but you can shoot them too. The last ship of the Droid flights goes into a spiraling pattern.

There is no end to this game. Rather, it is a game in which you try to get the highest score, or complete the highest number of levels.

You control a small triangle that is your ship. The ship can turn, move forward (with thrusters) and fire. Movement is one of the games challenges; once the ship is moving, it can only be slowed by turning the nose in the opposite direction and use the thrusters. While doing that, the ship is unable to fire toward anything it is in motion toward.

Bouncing also comes into play during movement. When the ship hits the side of the screen, a wall of force appears, and the ship bounces. You don't have control over where the ship bounces, and must take time to regain control, before you run into an enemy ship and die.</desc>

		<path>./Pac-Man.prg</path>
		<name>Pac-Man</name>
		<desc>One of the most popular and influential games of the 1980's, Pac-Man stars a little, yellow dot-muncher who works his way around to clear a maze of the various dots and fruit which inhabit the board.

Pac-Man's goal is continually challenged by four ghosts: The shy blue ghost Bashful (Inky), the trailing red ghost Shadow (Blinky), the fast pink ghost Speedy (Pinky), and the forgetful orange ghost Pokey (Clyde).  One touch from any of these ghosts means a loss of life for Pac-Man.

Pac-Man can turn the tables on his pursuers by eating of the four Energizers located within the maze.  During this time, the ghosts turn blue, and Pac-Man can eat them for bonus points.  This only lasts for a limited amount of time, as the ghost's eyes float back to their center box, and regenerate to chase after Pac-Man again.

Survive a few rounds of gameplay, and be treated to humorous intermissions between Pac-Man and the ghosts.</desc>

		<name>Q*bert</name>
		<desc>Q*bert is a conversion of the popular arcade game. The goal is to change all of the tiles on a pyramid to the target color. To do this you guide Q*bert around the pyramid, and every tile he hops on will change color. On early levels, a single hop will change the tile to the desired color, but on later levels you may need to hop on a tile multiple times or even avoid hopping on a tile multiple times! Trying to stop Q*bert are many different creatures which wander around the board, including Coily the snake, Slick and Sam, and falling balls. On the edge of the board are floating discs; if Q*bert jumps on one of these discs when the snake is in pursuit, the snake will fall off  the board while Q*bert is safely transported to the top.</desc>

		<desc>The second of the Sargon chess games. In this version, you can play the computer or another opponent. To move, you type the piece's location then the destination; such as A2-A4 to move the far left pawn forward 2 spaces. If you press a certain key, you can hide the board and see the moves that have been made so far. You can even make your moves from this screen, if you want the added challenge, without seeing the board. When you play the computer, you must select a level of play. The higher the level, the longer the computer thinks about its moves. In levels one through six, if you press the ? key, Sargon II will give you a hint of a good, but not necessarily the best, move.</desc>
