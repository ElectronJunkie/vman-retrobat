		<name>The House of the Dead 4</name>
		<desc>The House of the Dead 4 is an arcade game that takes place shortly after The House of the Dead 4 for up to two players working cooperatively. Kate Green from the original game teams up with G to deal with another zombie infestation. This leads them to the Magician, a boss character from the first two games in the series. Next to the Magician, Justice is another boss character encountered in the game. Just like the original title the player holds an uzi gun to attack the zombies from a first-person perspective. There are two large screens, the seats can shake and air is blown when taking damage. As a rail shooter movement is done automatically, the player only aims and shoots. Some sections of the game are done on foot and others in a vehicle. There are also moments where a branching path can be chosen and there are various cut-scenes shown from a third-person perspective. Entirely new for the series is the addition for a green life bar near the bottom of the screen, allowing for multiple hits, taking damage, before the game is over.</desc>

		<desc>2 Spicy is a cover based third person shooter made for arcades. The game is built around one-on-one fights between two players and is controlled with light guns and pedals. Pointing the gun at the screen allows the player to fire at the enemy while pointing away from the screen causes the player character to hide behind a cover such as an oil drum or a pillar. Moving between different covers is done by stepping on one of two pedals, causing the character to move either left or right. Stepping on a pedal twice allows the player to do jump shots when aiming at the screen and a dodge when aiming away. Aiming on the enemy for a certain amount of time causes the camera to zoom in and the player's attack power will be increased and it is possible to do a head shot for a large amount of damage.</desc>

Just like the previous games players command an aircraft from a third-person view, engaging enemies, dodging enemy fire and rockets and navigating through canyons and narrow passages. Gameplay requires quick reflexes and is arcade-like in design. The iconic F-14 Super Tomcat of the previous games has been replaced by a F-14D Super Tomcat with the addition of two new aircraft, F/A-18E Super Hornet and F-15E Strike Eagle. In the standard EX arcade mode there is a branching mission path with various objectives. Sometimes enemies need to be engaged, while other times friendly fighters help along, stealth must be used, or a specific target needs to be pursued and taken out. There are two main weapons: regular cannon fire for close distances and rockets that can only be used when they are locked on. There is also a Climax gauge that can be activated when it is full.</desc>

		<name>The King of Fighters XIII Climax</name>
		<desc>The King of Fighters XIII was released for PlayStation 3 late last year. Since then, SNK Playmore has collected, with much affection, suggestions and complaints from the fans about the game. From the PS3 release through April 2012, the company has been launching frequent updates based on their research to improve the game and make the title experience more accurate to the public's expectations. New characters have been added, the company has better balanced the game, removed some infinite combos that should not exist, among other improvements. Anyway, SNK Playmore, with a lot of sweat, had managed to finish the job, The King of Fighters XIII had stayed exactly as the gamers wanted. However, there was an issue that troubled the company. Originally the game was released for Arcade, and only after a time ported to the PS3. With the updates made, it was noted that the home version had gotten much better than the original version, making KOFXIII outdated in Arcade. Thinking about it, the company decided to do the reverse. If Arcade had given life to the game's home port, The King of Fighters XIII had to go back to Arcade and showcase all of its improvements, bringing back the glory of the franchise. With this premise is born The King of Fighters XIII Climax, made available a few days ago in Japan, bringing everything the version for PlayStation 3 has. Unfortunately, SNK distributor Atlus in the west has not revealed whether there are plans for the launch of KOFXIII Climax in the Arcades here.</desc>

		<desc>1904 D.C. (Darius Calendar)— When a Belser virus rent the hyperspace network to tatters, every craft in the human space fleet with a network link was stripped of all communications capabilities. The ensuing chaos saw the entire fleet devastated in the blink of an eye. The Silver Hawk fighters were the only craft from Planet Darius to escape the massacre. Equipped with Burst technology, these two cutting-edge craft were entrusted to humanoid AI terminal Ti2 and test pilot Riga Pratica. Flying the Silver Hawk Burst fighters alone into enemy territory without network support, the two heroes braved overwhelming odds to secure victory and liberation for Darius. It is now 1910 D.C., and repairs on the hyperspace network have begun to reconnect the pockets of humanity scattered across the vast reaches of space. Combat data transmitted from Darius soon sees Burstequipped Silver Hawk fighters constructed in every inhabited galaxy. The stage is set for mankind’s grand counteroffensive. A team of heroes takes wing, flying into battle and the pages of history.</desc>
